# pr-body-lint.py — the FLEET's PR-body linter, vendored so this repository's CI can run the real

#   upstream repo     PupFuzz/agent-board-framework  (PRIVATE — a public CI runner cannot clone it,

# ⚠ THAT sha256 IS THE WHOLE UPSTREAM FILE AND IS **NOT** THE FIGURE `bin/vendor-pin-check.sh` PINS,
# which is the BODY — this header excluded — and therefore a different number. Two figures, two

#
# ⚠ WHY THIS HEADER EXISTS AT ALL RATHER THAN THE FILE BEING COPIED CLEAN — it is not decoration
# and it is not style. `bin/vendor-pin-check.sh --selftest`'s CONTROL arm mutates LINE 2 to show
# that a header edit does NOT red the pin, and it REFUSES to run when line 2 is not a `#` comment;
# upstream's line 2 is the module docstring. The CI job runs `--selftest` first, so a copy taken
# clean reds the job before the lint ever runs — measured on a scratch copy, not predicted. A `#`
# comment placed before a module's first string statement does not displace `__doc__`, so `--help`
# and the docstring below are unaffected. The retired `bin/coord_audit_field.py` carried the
# same shape, which is where it was read from; it is named here as history, not as a path to
# follow — this commit deletes it.
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY THE REPLACEMENT IS NOT A PREFERENCE. `bin/pr-body-fields.py` +
# `bin/coord_audit_field.py` were a mezzanine-local two-field presence guard wrapped around
# `review-prep.py`'s `_audit_field` — vendored out of a file that function no longer lives in.
# Upstream ships a strict SUPERSET: the same two presence rules, plus the installer-POV narration

r"""pr-body-lint.py — the PR-body standard, ENFORCED instead of described (card#9073 leg B).

THE MEASURED DEFECT. `skills/release-pr/SKILL.md § PR body — write it for the software installer`
is the standard for what a PR body may contain — its closed section set and scope line on a
RELEASE PR only (the ⛔ RELEASE-SCOPE block below owns that split) — it is ratified twice by the
operator (roundtable #255, and again on 2026-09-09 naming the READER), and until this file NOTHING
CHECKED IT.
`review-prep.py` and the wrappers around it checked field PRESENCE — `Built:`,
`**Coordinated in:**` — never the ABSENCE of narration, so a body could carry every required
machine line and still be the essay the standard forbids. It did, repeatedly:

    "The PR for v0.50.0 doesn't meet my criteria. It is full of commentary again instead of
     what someone installing the package needs to know. For example, Why MINOR (0.49.0 →
     0.50.0) section and Correlation gaps"              — operator, 2026-09-08, card#9073

That body is this program's KNOWN POSITIVE: `PupFuzz/agent-board-framework` #847 as it stood at
2026-09-08T22:02:29Z (recoverable from the PR's `userContentEdits`; the live body at #847 has
since been rewritten to the standard and PASSES, which is the negative control). It reds on two
of the rules below and the operator's two named examples are exactly those two rows.

WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHERE EACH RULE COMES FROM. The rules are the STANDARD'S, not this file's —
`§ PR body`'s IN/OUT tables own every one of them and this program deliberately does not restate
their reasoning (canon #16: point, do not copy). What lives here is the executable form:

    scope-line          the IN table's `Scope line` row — one line, FIRST, naming the range.
    heading-not-allowed the IN table, read as a closed set — `ALLOWED_H2` below is its
                        executable form and the section's own `pr-body-lint:allowed-h2` marker
                        block is what a drift check holds the two equal against, so neither this
                        paragraph nor any other prose restates the set. Any H2 outside it is a
                        section the standard gives a home OUTSIDE the body, so it reds here.
    banned-opener       the OUT table, read as the phrases those homes actually begin with.
                        `BANNED_OPENERS` below is the set, held equal to the section's
                        `pr-body-lint:banned-openers` marker block by the same drift check — so
                        this paragraph names the rule and not its membership, for the reason the
                        row above gives: a prose list here is a copy nothing guards.
    built-missing       the IN table's machine-read row + `docs/built-line.md`. A BOT-AUTHORED
                        PR is exempt from this row and the next, and from nothing else — the
                        ⛔ block below owns that exemption and its discriminator.
    coordinated-missing the IN table's machine-read row.
    attribution-line    the OUT table's `FROM:` / `TO:` row — a PR body carries NO attribution
                        line, on ANY repo (see below).
    ai-attribution      the OUT table's AI-attribution row — no line names the AI model, carries
                        a Claude session link or co-author trailer, or carries the context stamp
                        (operator-directed, card#10673). `AI_ATTRIBUTION_SHAPES` is the closed
                        shape table, a vendored region shared with `squash-message.sh`, and its
                        names are held equal to the section's `pr-body-lint:ai-attribution`
                        marker block by the same drift check.
    live-state-reading  the OUT table's `Readings` row, for the part of it a program can decide:
                        a CLOSED table of claim shapes about LIVE CI / push / base state
                        (`LIVE_STATE_READINGS` below, held equal to the section's
                        `pr-body-lint:live-state-readings` marker block by the same drift check).

⛔ `attribution-line` IS OPERATOR-DIRECTED AND IT IS THE ONE RULE HERE THAT REFUSES A LINE THE
STANDARD USED TO REQUIRE. A PR body carries no `FROM:` / `TO:` attribution line, on any repo
(operator, 2026-09-11, card#9229 → card#9073 leg E). Those lines are the COORDINATION channel's —
an issue body and a comment still carry them, unchanged, and `docs/protocol-spec.md` § Addressing
owns the rule for all three surfaces. A PR is attributed by the ROSTER'S REPO BINDING instead (the
coordination repo → pm; an impl repo → the seat whose roster entry owns it), which is what
`templates/bin/handoff-check.py`'s `attribute_pr` now reads and what the coordination repo's
protocol-integrity Action now enforces on `pull_request_target`. The pair that discriminates this
rule is one PR again: fw#891's body as it stood at `2026-09-10T14:08:53Z` (it opened on
`FROM: pm`) against the same body after the operator's ruling.

⛔ A BOT-AUTHORED PR IS EXEMPT FROM THE TWO AUDIT ROWS, AND FROM NOTHING ELSE (card#9927). A
dependency bot opens a PR with no dispatch behind it and no coordination thread to anchor to, so
it can declare neither `Built:` nor `**Coordinated in:**` TRUTHFULLY — and on an adopter that
gates self-merge on this workflow, that red is what stops a SECURITY BUMP from landing until a
person hand-edits the bot's body. That is a MEASUREMENT, twice: an adopter seat reported it on its
own live Dependabot PR (card#9927), and it re-derives here on this repo's own — `gh api
repos/PupFuzz/agent-board-framework/pulls/426 --jq .body` into `--body-file` gives rc 1 on exactly
`built-missing` + `coordinated-missing` and nothing else, and rc 0 with `--author-type-env` naming
a variable set to `Bot`. No fixture is committed for it because, unlike the pairs above, the pair
that discriminates here is not two BODIES: it is one body under two author types, which is what
`pr-body-lint.selftest.py`'s `arm_h` drives. The exemption lives HERE, in the one
program, rather than as an `if:` on the workflow job — an adopter's vendored copy is
byte-identical and needs no local fork, and the review path (`review-prep.py`) reads the same
rule rather than a second one.

THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE EVENT'S `user.type`, NEVER AN AUTHOR LOGIN — `author_is_bot` below is
the whole of it. GitHub sets that field from the ACCOUNT KIND and the PR's author cannot choose
it; a login is a string that enumerates one bot at a time, and is already known to arrive in more
than one spelling for a SINGLE bot (`dependabot[bot]` on the REST / webhook payload,
`app/dependabot` as `gh`'s projection renders it — `templates/kanban/examples/kanban-prs-sync.py`'s
`_is_bot` carries that measurement and the double-carding defect it caused). Type covers
Dependabot, Renovate and every other GitHub App at once, with nothing enumerated and nothing to
add when an adopter installs a bot this repo has never heard of. The coordination-repo skeleton's
`.github/scripts/protocol-integrity.js` decided the SAME question the same way
(`commentSkipReason`, "this predicate never reads the author LOGIN — type is the discriminator"),
and it states the fleet fact that makes the exemption safe here too: agents post through a SHARED
PAT and come back `user.type: "User"`, so no agent-authored PR is exempted by this.

AND IT FAILS CLOSED, WHICH IS THE ONLY DIRECTION AVAILABLE TO A PROVENANCE CHECK. Nothing but the
exact string `Bot` is a bot: no author at all (a `--body-file` run from a terminal, and every
caller that passes none — `review-prep.py` is one), a variable that is unset, an empty or
whitespace value, any other account type, any other casing. An exemption that fired when it could
not PROVE the author is a bot would let any body shed its audit rows by naming a variable the
lint cannot read. The residue is therefore deliberate and is not a degradation to hide: a
workflow that does not pass the field gets TODAY's behaviour — both rows required — which is a
red the author can see, never a silent pass.

⛔ THE RELEASE STANDARD JUDGES RELEASE PRs, AND ONLY THEM (card#10493). `ALLOWED_H2`'s members are
RELEASE nouns — `Bundled` and `Release artifacts` mean nothing on a feature PR — so while every
rule ran on every body, a feature PR failed this lint BY CONSTRUCTION. Measured: the
`BWtek-Medical/sola-device` feature PRs card#10493 lists each spent a review finding on
`heading-not-allowed` for `## Summary` / `## SaMD boundary check` / `## CI action-pin resync
check`, headings that repo's own PR template and shape guard REQUIRE. A non-release PR's section
shape is its repo's to define, so only the rules that model that SHAPE are scoped:
  * RELEASE ONLY — `scope-line` and `heading-not-allowed`. They are § PR body's IN table read as a
    CLOSED set of release sections opened by a release range line, and nothing else here models a
    section shape.
  * EVERY PR — everything else. `banned-opener` and `live-state-reading` are § PR body's OUT table,
    and the OUT table's relocations (narration, the audit trail, findings and readings go to the
    review-request round) bind every PR body whatever its section shape — § PR body says so, and
    `live-state-reading` was minted on fw#873, a feature PR. `built-missing` and
    `coordinated-missing` (`docs/built-line.md` requires `Built:` on every PR body, and plane 1 of
    `docs/pr-review-flow.md` reads `**Coordinated in:**` off every PR), and `attribution-line`
    (`docs/protocol-spec.md` § Addressing: no `FROM:` / `TO:` on a PR body, on any repo —
    operator-directed) and `ai-attribution` (`docs/engineering-canon.md`'s standing instruction —
    operator-directed) have fleet-wide owners of their own.
The ALLOW-SET IS NOT WIDENED to admit a feature PR's headings: that would keep a closed set of
release nouns and silence the findings about a different document (canon #3).

THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE PR TITLE'S `release:` PREFIX — `judged_as_release` below is the whole of
it. It is the one mark the release flow ALREADY puts on every release PR (`release-pr` SKILL.md's
checklist, criterion 5: `release: vX.Y.Z`), and it needs NO CONFIGURATION to read: the
`pull_request` event carries it into CI, `review-prep` has it on the PR it already reads, and an
author about to run `gh pr create --title` has it in hand. The BASE BRANCH was the alternative and
was ruled out on exactly that: which bases are release branches is per-install config
(`branch_model.release`, plus every `branch_model.lines` entry's `release`, which only
`templates/bin/branch-lines.sh` resolves), and this file runs in an adopter's CI with no
coordination config beside it — so it would have to guess `main`, and would judge a declared
line's release PR as a feature PR.

AND A MISSING TITLE IS A RELEASE PR, WHICH IS THE STRICT SIDE. No title at all — a terminal
`--body-file` run, an old copy of the workflow that does not pass one, a caller that names an unset
variable — cannot prove the PR is not a release, so the body gets the full standard, which is
exactly what every body got before this split. The run SAYS so, so a feature author who forgot
`--title` sees why their `## Summary` reds. The RESIDUE, named rather than hidden: a release PR
whose title does not open `release:` is judged as a feature PR and escapes the section rules. The
title is itself a release checklist item, visible on the PR page, so the miss is a checklist
finding as well as a lint one.

⛔ IT IS ONE PROGRAM WITH TWO CONSUMERS AND THAT IS WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY. It runs (1) in
every install's CI, from `templates/workflows/pr-body-lint.yml`, on `pull_request` opened / edited
/ synchronize; and (2) inside the review path, where `hooks/bin/review-prep.py` spawns it as a
CHILD and transports its answer into the digest `coord-review prepare` builds — the same
delegation, for the same reason, that `review-prep` already applies to `ci-read`: a second
implementation of one verdict is the divergence canon #5 forbids, and it would be the divergence
that matters here (two answers to "does this body meet the standard", one of them green).

⛔ SO IT IS A SINGLE SELF-CONTAINED FILE, IMPORTING NOTHING BUT THE STDLIB, AND THE FENCE TRACKER
IS A VENDORED REGION RATHER THAN AN IMPORT. `templates/bin/handoff-check.py` joined the same
`fence-mask` group for the identical reason and its registry entry states it: a file that deploys
as ONE file — to `~/.local/bin`, and into an adopting repo's `bin/` for CI — has no sibling to
import. `hooks/bin/_fence.py` is the review family's adapter over the SAME fragment and the two
cannot drift: `tools/gen-vendored.py --check` runs in CI and asserts this region byte-for-byte
against `plugins/coord/_vendor/fence-mask.py.txt`.

⛔ AND THE FENCE RULE IS NOT A NICETY HERE — IT IS WHAT KEEPS THIS PROGRAM FROM MANUFACTURING
FINDINGS. A PR body that DOCUMENTS the standard in a fenced example is ordinary in this repo,
whose PRs are largely about the lines this file reads; a heading or a banned opener QUOTED inside
a fence is payload, not the body's own claim. Reading them as the body's would produce a FAIL
against a body that is RIGHT, and a false accusation is worse than no check at all — that is
`_audit_field`'s own measured lesson (card#9047 r2), one layer up. Every rule below runs over the
fence-aware line scan and never over the raw text.

⛔ WHAT IT REFUSES TO JUDGE, STATED SO A GREEN RUN IS NOT OVER-READ.
  * **H3 and below are not checked.** The allowlist is the IN table's SECTION set, and the
    standard admits sub-structure inside `## Highlights` (the shipped generator emits it). A
    narrating `###` therefore passes here and is a HUMAN finding at review. Narrowed on purpose:
    a rule that cannot be stated from the IN table is one this file would be inventing.
  * **Everything after an UNCLOSED fence is invisible to every rule here.** CommonMark runs an
    unclosed ``` ``` ``` to end of document, so the fence tracker below marks the whole remainder
    as payload and a body that opens a fence and never closes it PASSES on whatever follows —
    measured, not reasoned: a compliant preamble, an unclosed fence, then `## Correlation gaps`
    and `### Why MINOR` → rc 0, zero findings. That is the renderer's own reading (the reader
    sees that text as a code block too), so it is not a bug in the tracker; it is an escape hatch,
    and a green over such a body is a statement about a document that ends inside a fence rather
    than about the body's sections. Named here because this block exists to stop exactly that
    over-read. (An unclosed fence ABOVE the audit rows reds on three rules instead — only the
    SUFFIX case is silent.)
  * **It never judges whether a line is TRUE** — only whether the body is in the shape the
    standard describes. Whether a `Built:` count matches what happened is plane 1's, on the
    body's edit history (`pr-review-flow.md`). `live-state-reading` is no exception: it reds on a
    reading whether or not the reading holds at the head, because the standard homes every
    reading outside the body — the comment above `LIVE_STATE_READINGS` owns why it refuses the
    shape rather than comparing the claim with the head.
  * **`live-state-reading` judges its CLOSED shape table and nothing else.** A CI / push / base
    claim in words no shape matches PASSES here, so a green says only that no line matched one
    of those shapes. Named residues, each pinned by a driven row in the selftest: a base other
    than `dev` or `main` (`3 commits behind release`) is NOT judged — pm ruling on card#9073 leg
    B-2, and the table is not to be widened with a pattern; markdown emphasis BETWEEN a shape's
    words (`CI is **green** at <sha>`) is not judged, because no decoration is stripped inside a
    line; a reading split across table cells is not judged, because no shape crosses a `|`. And,
    from the narrowings fw#910 r1 forced so that pass conditions and descriptions of a tool stop
    reding: a reading whose opening token follows a word (`Note CI is green at <sha>`) is not
    judged, because every shape but `behind-base` must open its clause; a sha of decimal digits
    alone is not judged, because a sha must carry a hex letter; a ZERO count is not judged, because
    a pass condition and a reading share that shape (`a pass is 0 commits behind dev`, and fw#627's
    real reading `0 commits behind origin/dev (bcdc12bb)`), so the rule withholds both. Named
    FALSE REDS, each pinned RED by a driven row in the selftest's `LIVE_KNOWN_FALSE_REDS`:
    `behind-base` does not open its clause, so a description of a tool with a NON-ZERO count in
    `<n> commits behind|ahead of <base>` (`refuses when the branch is 5 commits behind dev`, `warns
    when the branch is 3 commits ahead of main`) reds — no shape separates it from a reading, which
    also puts a word before the count (`The branch is 2 commits behind`). Reworded without
    `<n> commits behind|ahead of <base>`, the description passes.

⚠ WHAT IT ECHOES. A finding PRINTS THE OFFENDING LINE (clipped to `LINE_CLIP` characters), never
a tally — a count of findings is a figure that is false on the next edit and tells the author
nothing about which line to fix (canon #16). The line is the PR body's own text, which is already
displayed to everyone who can read the PR; the CI log this program writes to is readable at the
same access level, so echoing it moves no value across a boundary. It is not a secret-bearing
surface and this program does not read one: it reads a body, from a file or an environment
variable the caller names, and nothing else.

Exit codes: 0 = the body meets the standard | 1 = at least one finding | 2 = usage / input fault.

def pin_std_streams():
    """Pin this program's stdout and stderr so no character it writes can KILL the write.

    THE DEFECT THIS ENDS. Python's text streams encode with the `strict` error handler, and
    outside a UTF-8 locale their codec is the platform's — `cp1252` on the fleet's Windows
    seat, for a redirected stream as well as for an old console. The first character that
    codec cannot represent raises `UnicodeEncodeError` *inside* the write, so the process
    dies with a traceback and the stream it was writing to is left EMPTY. Measured on the
    tool whose whole subject is refusing empty answers: `git-object-id --help` under
    `PYTHONIOENCODING=cp1252` exits 1 with ZERO BYTES on stdout, because the contract it
    prints contains one `⛔`. A reader who asks a tool what it promises, and is handed
    nothing, reads that as "the tool has nothing to say" — the wrong-population zero,
    produced by the help path of the tool written to forbid it.

    THREE PROPERTIES, AND EACH IS LOAD-BEARING ON ITS OWN.
      * `encoding="utf-8"` — the tooling's text IS UTF-8 (arrows, em-dashes, box drawing,
        accented names come out of coordination data, not out of decoration), so the stream
        is pinned to the codec that can carry all of it rather than left on whatever the
        machine's locale happens to be. This is also what makes a redirected stream a FILE
        of known bytes instead of a file whose encoding depends on which seat produced it.
      * `errors="backslashreplace"` — the residue after that pin. UTF-8 still cannot encode
        a LONE SURROGATE, which is exactly what an undecodable byte in a filename becomes
        once it has been through the filesystem's `surrogateescape` decode, so a program
        that prints a path it did not choose can still meet a character its stream refuses.
        The handler makes that one character print as `\\udcXX` and lets the rest of the
        line through. THE DIRECTION IS THE POINT: an unprintable character must cost its own
        glyph, never the whole message.
      * `newline="\\n"` — Windows opens a text stream in TEXT MODE and translates every
        `\\n` written into `\\r\\n`. Any consumer that captures this program's stdout and
        compares, splits or evaluates a field then compares a value with a carriage return
        welded onto it, and the mismatch names nothing. Pinning at the PRODUCER is what lets
        a reader rely on it, rather than every reader stripping `\\r` for itself.

    WHY THE ERROR HANDLER IS NOT LEFT STRICT once the encoding is pinned: `strict` is the
    setting that turns an unrepresentable character into NO OUTPUT AT ALL. There is no
    caller anywhere for whom that is the better answer — a diagnostic that cannot be printed
    is not a diagnostic — and the two settings are independent, so pinning one and leaving
    the other is how the crash survives a fix aimed at it. Note that `reconfigure(encoding=)`
    RESETS the handler to `strict` when `errors=` is omitted (measured, CPython 3.14), which
    is why the two travel together in one call and never in two — and why NOTHING LATER IN A
    HOST MAY CALL `reconfigure(encoding=…)` AGAIN. A second such call, however well meant,
    silently undoes this one on both streams and leaves the program back at the setting that
    prints nothing; the framework repo's population guard reds on it two ways, statically and
    by reading the handler the program leaves installed at runtime.

    STDIN IS DELIBERATELY NOT TOUCHED. This is an ENCODE failure — a property of what the
    program writes — and stdin's decode is a different question with a different right
    answer per program: a reader that must not corrupt bytes reads `sys.stdin.buffer` and
    decodes explicitly, and pinning the text layer underneath it would say something about a
    stream that program never uses.

    A STREAM THAT CANNOT BE RECONFIGURED IS LEFT ALONE, and that is the whole of the failure
    handling. `reconfigure` exists on a real `TextIOWrapper`; a stream replaced by a test
    harness, or absent entirely, has neither the method nor the defect. There is no second
    attempt with fewer arguments, because no stream accepts one of these keywords and
    refuses another — a fallback rung there would be code for a state that cannot arise, and
    it would hide the one case worth knowing about by making it look handled.

    string may not itself contain a backtick); it closes on the first line with >= as many of
    the SAME character and nothing but whitespace after; an unclosed fence runs to end of
    document. Indented (4-space) code blocks are NOT tracked, and the PRECONDITION that makes
    that safe belongs to the caller, not to this: a scanner anchored at column 0 excludes an
    indented example BY ITS OWN ANCHOR. This sentence used to assert that as a fact about "the
    scanners that care", and a scanner that deliberately tolerates leading whitespace falsified
    it (`dispatch-grant.MARKERISH_RE`, which must still see a HAND-MANGLED marker and therefore
    cannot anchor at column 0). A caller that tolerates indentation reads an indented example as

# ── The body-lint kernel ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHAT THIS FRAGMENT IS, AND WHY IT IS A FRAGMENT RATHER THAN A SECOND COPY (card#9550 leg 1).
#
# A body lint is a program that reads ONE markdown body a human or an agent authored, decides
# whether it is in the SHAPE a standard describes, and refuses it with a message that teaches the
# standard. This repo now has two such programs, enforcing two UNRELATED standards:
# `templates/bin/pr-body-lint.py` (the PR-body standard) and `templates/bin/coord-ask-operator`
# (the operator-question shape). Their RULES share nothing — different closed heading sets, for
# different reasons, owned by different documents — but the machinery under the rules is the same
# five things, and NONE of those five is about either standard's content:
#
#   * `LINE_CLIP` / `Finding` — one rule, one line, that line's own text, clipped for an echo.
#     Never a tally.
#   * `scan` — a fence-aware per-line view of the body, with the zip-length assertion that keeps
#     a truncated answer from reading like a clean one.
#   * `field_values` / `field_value` — the machine-read-line grammar: `Name:` or `**Name:**` at
#     the start of an unfenced line, with a non-blank value.
#   * `read_body` — the `--body-file` / `--env` dual source, with `--env` existing for the
#     shell-injection reason the workflow template states.
#
# ⛔ THE ARGUMENT FOR HOISTING IT IS THE HOST'S OWN HISTORY, NOT A PREFERENCE. `field_value`'s
# ancestor `_audit_field` was itself a consolidation: `Built:` and `Coordinated in:` had been
# matched by TWO hand-written regexes strict in OPPOSITE directions, so each rejected the spelling
# the other required and a compliant PR was reported ABSENT. `pr-body-lint.py`'s own docstring for
# that function calls two regexes for one family "the measured defect this consolidation fixed."
# Hand-copying the same five mechanisms into a second lint re-creates, one layer out, exactly the
# shape that consolidation ended (canon #5: a second divergent implementation of one behavior is a
# defect, not a style choice).
#
# ⛔ WHAT IT DOES NOT CARRY, AND THE LINE IS THE POINT. No rule, no heading set, no phrase table,
# no exit-code dispatch, no CLI parser. A standard's CONTENT is its own program's, and a rule that
# drifted in here would be this fragment inventing a standard for two hosts at once. Host-specific
# reasoning — why THIS host needed the kernel, what its fields mean, what it measured — stays
# OUTSIDE the markers, hand-authored, per host, the same rule the `fence-mask` group states.
#
# ⛔ IT ASSUMES `os`, `re` AND `sys` ARE IMPORTED IN THE HOST, and `mask_fenced` / `fenced_flags`
# — the `fence-mask` group. Every host here is a copy of that group too; a host that were not
# would fail on the first body it read rather than silently, because `field_value` calls
# `mask_fenced` unconditionally.

# The per-finding echo cap. An authored line is text of unbounded length and a finding becomes one
# line of a CI log, a review digest or a terminal refusal; an unclipped echo of a 70 KB line is a
# finding nobody can read. The number is this fragment's own and nothing is measured against it —
# it is not a threshold.

    Both are measured-live in this repo's own PR bodies (`pr-body-lint._audit_field`'s docstring
    owns that measurement and the sample it came from); the colon-OUTSIDE spelling `**Name**:`
    appears zero times in it and is deliberately NOT accepted, because tolerating an unmeasured
    form widens the guard for nobody (canon #3).

    ⛔ `[ \t]*`, NEVER `\s*`, BETWEEN THE FIELD NAME AND ITS VALUE. `\s` matches `\n`, so the

# marker block by the same drift check that holds `ALLOWED_H2` / `BANNED_OPENERS` above, and every

#
# ⛔ IT REFUSES THE SHAPE; IT DOES NOT COMPARE THE CLAIM WITH THE HEAD — pm ruling on the leg B-2
# fork, and the reason is the consumer that gates. In CI this program runs on `pull_request`
# opened / edited / synchronize with a depth-1 checkout and no API read: it is ITSELF one of the
# runs on the head, so "every run terminal" is never true while it runs, and nothing re-runs it
# when CI concludes or the base moves. A green from a comparison would be a reading taken at lint
# time — the defect this rule exists to catch, one level up. The standard already answers the
# product question (a reading lives only in a sha-bound artefact; the body carries its
# derivation), so no head facts are read and there is no not-checked path.
#
# ⛔ A QUOTED CLAIM COUNTS — pm ruling, deliberately. fw#873's final body quotes its own first
# revision (`Revision 1 asserted "CI has not run on this head; the branch is not pushed"`), and a
# line like that reds here. `banned-opener` does not separate quoted from asserted text either, and
# a body quoting a stale reading is narration the OUT table moves out of the body anyway. A FENCED
# line is still payload, as it is for every rule here.
#
# THE SHAPE OF EACH PATTERN IS LOAD-BEARING. Every one is ONE outer group with no top-level `|`, so
# `(?!)` prefixed to it disables the whole shape — which is how the selftest's per-shape mutants
# show each one is what produced its red. Gaps are `[^.\n|]{…}` and literal spaces, never `\s`, for
# the mask doctrine's reason (see `_DECORATION_RE` above), and no shape crosses a `|`. A sha is 7–40
# hex characters with at least one digit AND at least one letter, so neither an all-letter word
# (`defaced`) nor a decimal number (`2026091`) is a sha. Bases are `dev` and `main` BY NAME and only
# by name (pm ruling; the header names the residue): `(?![\w/-]|\.\w)` ends the name, so a base that
# merely BEGINS with one (`dev-next`, `main-v2`, `origin/main-lts`, `dev/feature`) is another base,
# while a sentence's closing `.` still ends `main`.
#
# ⛔ A READING IS NOT ITS OWN PASS CONDITION — fw#910 r1 M1. The finding asks for a derivation and
# the conditions under which its output is a pass, and those conditions restate the reading (`a pass
# is 0 commits behind dev`, `a pass means CI is green at this head`); so does a description of what a
# tool does (`waits until all tags are pushed`). Closed narrowings separate them, each pinned by a
# mutant in the selftest's `LIVE_NARROWINGS`. A COUNT of zero is not judged (`[1-9]\d*`): a condition
# and a reading share that shape, so it withholds both, and the header names the zero-count reading
# as a residue. And every shape but
# `behind-base` OPENS ITS CLAUSE: `(?<!\w )` refuses the token a shape opens on when it follows a
# word and a space (a sha's optional backtick gets `(?<!\w `)` for the same reason). A condition or a
# description embeds the claim after a word (`means`, `until`, `when`); a reading opens on it, after
# a list marker, emphasis, a cell's `|`, a quote or clause punctuation. `behind-base` is exempt
# because its own reading puts a word before the count (`The branch is 2 commits behind`), and its
# conditions are written with zero counts. The residue — a reading introduced by a word — and
# `behind-base`'s false red — a description of a tool with a non-zero count — are the header's.

# ── AI attribution — the lines no GitHub-bound text may carry (card#10673, operator-directed) ──
# The operator's ruling, verbatim: "On all github posts (PRs, Tasks, etc), I do not want bodies or
# comments to indicate the AI model used to generate the code or provide a session link." The
# ruling on the context stamp followed it: "Yes, remove any AI attributions". So no commit message,
# PR description, issue, comment or card is to carry the lines below. The rule's owner is
# `docs/engineering-canon.md`'s standing instruction (for the context stamp, card#10673's operator
# ruling); this table is its executable form.
#
# `(shape name, pattern)`. Each pattern is applied with `search` to ONE line and never spans a
# line break (`[ \t]`, never `\s`). The table is CLOSED: a line that names a model in words no
# shape matches is NOT judged, so a clean result means only "no line matched one of these shapes".
#   co-author-trailer  the harness's commit trailer, `Co-Authored-By: <name> <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
#                      It is the line that makes GitHub list a second author on the commit.
#                      Anchored at the line start (after an optional `>` quote), so a trailer quoted
#                      mid-line in prose is not judged. It is keyed on the harness's own
#                      `noreply@anthropic.com` ADDRESS alone, whatever name precedes it — never on
#                      the name: a human co-author named `Claude …` is a person's credit, and
#                      dropping it would erase that person from the landed commit (fw#1095 r1).
#   session-trailer    the `Claude-Session:` commit trailer, anchored the same way.
#   session-link       a claude.ai session URL anywhere on the line. It requires a real session-id
#                      character after `session_`, so a placeholder written `session_…` or
#                      `session_<id>` is not a link and is not judged.
#   generated-footer   the harness's PR footer, `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](…)`, with or without
#                      the link brackets. Before it only spaces, `>` quote marks and the harness's
#                      own robot emoji (U+1F916, optionally with its variation selector) may stand,
#                      so prose that quotes the words — a list item, a backtick — is not judged
#                      (fw#1095 r1).
#   ctx-stamp          the context-fill stamp, `<!-- CTX: <digits>% … -->`. It requires the digits,
#                      as the stamp's own reader does, so the form written `<pct>%` is not judged.

# ── The audit-row grammar — ONE OWNER FOR BOTH CONSUMERS ─────────────────────────────────────
def _audit_field(body, name):
    r"""The VALUE of the audit-trail line `name` in `body`, or `None` when the body carries none.

    ⛔ ONE GRAMMAR FOR THE WHOLE AUDIT-ROW FAMILY — THIS IS A PRIMITIVE BECAUSE TWO OF THEM WERE
    A DEFECT (canon #5). `Built:` and `**Coordinated in:**` are one family: same section, same
    contract, read by the same reviewer. They were matched by two hand-written regexes, strict in
    OPPOSITE directions — one demanded the `**` wrapper, the other refused it — so each rejected
    the spelling the other required, and a compliant PR was reported ABSENT. A verdict of ABSENT
    against a line that is RIGHT THERE is worse than no check: `agents/impl-reviewer.md § INPUT`
    tells the reviewer to CITE these lines rather than re-derive them, so the false accusation is
    what gets carried into the round. A third field added later must call this and not a third
    regex.

    THE ACCEPTED SPELLINGS ARE MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. Over this repo's last 100 PR bodies
    (`gh api pulls?per_page=100`, counted 2026-09-07): `**Built:**` on 27 lines and plain `Built:`
    on 46; `**Coordinated in:**` on 55 and plain `Coordinated in:` on 9. BOTH spellings are live
    for BOTH fields, and both are documented in this tree — `docs/built-line.md` and
    `agents/impl-reviewer.md` write the bold form, `skills/release-pr/SKILL.md`'s Step-10
    checklist writes the plain one. The colon-OUTSIDE spelling `**Built**:` appears 0 times in
    that sample and is deliberately NOT accepted: tolerating an unmeasured form widens the guard
    for nobody (canon #3).

    What is NOT relaxed is the rest of the shape — line-anchored, at the start of the line, with a
    non-blank value. A `Built:` inside prose, or a bold header with nothing after it, is still
    not an audit-trail line, and for `Built:` the VALUE is then checked against the canonical set
    by the caller.

    ⛔ AND IT LIVES IN THIS FILE — THE card#9073 MOVE, AND IT IS A MOVE, NOT A COPY. It was
    `review-prep._audit_field` while review-prep was its only consumer. A repo's CI became the
    second consumer, on the far side of a deploy boundary review-prep cannot cross: this program
    runs standalone, in a tree where nothing of this plugin exists. THREE SHAPES WERE MEASURED
    against this checkout before this one was chosen. (1) A hand-synced second copy: the defect
    the paragraph above describes, one layer out, and the shape card#4953 built the vendoring
    engine to end. (2) A VENDORED REGION over both files — the engine's designed use, and it was
    STRUCTURALLY UNAVAILABLE when this was chosen: a group carried ONE `exec` bit for all its
    copies, `hooks/bin/review-prep.py` is 100755 because `install-linked-bin.sh` puts it on PATH
    BY SYMLINK (a link to a non-executable target cannot be run), and this file was then 100644.
    `--write` proved it by chmod'ing review-prep.py to 644 the moment the group was declared.
    ⚠ THAT MODE ARGUMENT NO LONGER HOLDS: since card#9211 this file is a PATH entry point listed
    in `templates/bin/.entrypoints`, which the engine holds to 100755, so an `exec: True` group
    over the pair would keep both executable. The choice of (3) has not been revisited since.
    (Read the pair's modes from git, never from this sentence: `git ls-tree <ref>
    --format='%(objectmode) %(path)' -- plugins/coord/hooks/bin/review-prep.py
    plugins/coord/templates/bin/pr-body-lint.py`. `templates/bin` as a whole is a MIX of both
    modes, which is why no directory-wide mode claim belongs here.)
    (3) ONE OWNER, TRANSPORTED — this. `review-prep.py`
    loads this file BY PATH through `hooks/bin/_modload.py` (the family's sanctioned loader) and
    reads `audit_fields()` and `findings()` off it, exactly as it delegates plane 1 to `ci-read`
    rather than re-deriving a CI verdict. One grammar, one file, no copy to keep in step.

    ⛔ AND IT IS READ OUTSIDE THE BODY'S FENCES, WHICH WAS THE DEFECT (card#9047
    r2). A PR body that DOCUMENTS this grammar in a fenced example — ordinary in this repo, whose
    PRs are largely about the lines this function reads — had its EXAMPLE read as its FIELD:
    driven, a body whose fence contained `Built: dispatched (coder x9 / mechanic x9)` and
    `Coordinated in: evil/repo#1` returned exactly those, while its REAL lines sat below the
    fence. That is a plane-1 verdict computed off text the author quoted rather than claimed, on
    the surface `agents/impl-reviewer.md § INPUT` tells the reviewer to CITE instead of
    re-deriving — and `coord-review` then routes `--thread` off the same example's ref. The rule
    is the record's own (`coord-review.py`'s machine-line note): a fenced line is QUOTED PAYLOAD,
    never the document's own answer, and it is one module so the two cannot drift.

    The fail-safe direction is deliberate: a body whose ONLY `Built:` line is inside a fence now
    reads as ABSENT, which is a finding the author fixes by unfencing their own line, rather than
    a PASS computed from somebody else's text.
