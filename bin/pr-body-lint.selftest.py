#                     — the WHOLE upstream file, NOT the body figure vendor-pin-check pins.
#
# ⚠ IT MUST BE RE-VENDORED IN THE SAME COMMIT AS THE TOOL. It resolves both `pr-body-lint.py` and
# `pr-body-lint-fixtures/` relative to ITS OWN directory, and it asserts a pinned sha256 for every
# fixture it reads — so a selftest from one upstream revision run against a tool or fixtures from
# another is a red, and correctly so.
#
# ⭐ THIS IS ALSO WHAT PINS THE FIXTURES, AND IT IS A BETTER PIN THAN THIS REPO COULD WRITE.
# `bin/vendor-pin-check.sh` has no manifest row for `pr-body-lint-fixtures/*`: those files are
# captured PR bodies with no shebang and no header, so the body rule that script derives has
# nothing to anchor on and its control arm (line 2 must be a `#` comment) cannot be built over a
# markdown document. It needs none — the `FIXTURES` table below carries a sha256 for every fixture
# this suite reads, and the suite reds by name when one does not match. Those figures are
# UPSTREAM'S OWN, so unlike a locally-minted pin they check the copy against the source rather than
# against this repo's last declaration. `README.md` in that directory carries no figure and is
# documentation of the captured bodies' provenance.
#
# ⚠ WHY THIS HEADER EXISTS — `bin/vendor-pin-check.sh --selftest`'s control arm requires line 2 to
# be a `#` comment and upstream's line 2 is the docstring. `bin/pr-body-lint.py`'s header states
# the measurement and the reasoning; not restated here.

r"""pr-body-lint.selftest.py — the PR-body lint's own controls (card#9073).

THE FAILURE THIS GUARDS IS SILENT, WHICH IS WHY EVERY ROW IS RED-THEN-GREEN. A lint that has
stopped reding is byte-indistinguishable from a body that complies: both print one OK line and
exit 0. So no rule here is trusted because it passed — each is driven against a body built to
break it, and each is additionally driven through a MUTANT of the shipped file with that one rule
disabled, which must flip the answer. A rule whose mutant still reds was never what produced the
red.

THERE IS ONE SUCH PAIR PER RULING, each keyed in `FIXTURES` below. Each is a REAL BODY OF A REAL PR
BEFORE AND AFTER IT, except where its negative is HAND-BUILT and says so below (`pr-body-lint-
fixtures/README.md` owns their provenance and the sha256 pins are in `FIXTURES`). The fw#847 pair —
its v0.50.0 body — is the commentary ruling:

  * the KNOWN POSITIVE — fw#847's v0.50.0 body as the operator read it, which must RED, and must
    red on the two rows the operator named BY NAME, not merely somewhere;
  * the KNOWN NEGATIVE — the same body after the rewrite, which must PASS.

The fw#891 pair — its v0.51.0 body — is the ATTRIBUTION-LINE ruling (operator, 2026-09-11,
card#9229 → card#9073 leg E: a PR body carries no `FROM:` / `TO:` line, on any repo). Its positive
is the body at `2026-09-10T14:08:53Z`, which opened on `FROM: pm`; its negative is the same body
after the line was struck. `arm_f` drives it, and it drives the same pair through a mutant with the
rule unwired, because the positive ALSO reds on `heading-not-allowed` — "it reds" would therefore
have been true of that body before this rule existed at all.

The fw#873 pair — its body — is the LIVE-STATE READING rule (card#9073 comment 4102, leg B-2).
Its positive is the body as first published (`2026-09-08T20:59:57Z`), whose `CI has not run on this
head. The branch is not pushed` and `2 commits behind origin/dev` lines are the instance the rule
was minted on. ⛔ ITS NEGATIVE IS HAND-BUILT, not a later revision: fw#873 never rewrote those lines
into derivations (its later revisions restated readings), so no real negative exists. The warning
below applies to it, and what answers that warning is an assertion rather than trust: `arm_g`
requires the negative to be BYTE-IDENTICAL to the real positive on every line but exactly the lines
the rule reds on, each replaced by the command that re-derives it and its pass conditions. And
`arm_g` drives the pair through a mutant with the rule unwired, because the positive ALSO reds on
older rules.

A rule that reds on both is measuring length, not the standard. The pair is what tells them apart,
and it is why a hand-written "compliant body" fixture is present as well but is not the whole of
the negative side: a body someone wrote to pass the lint they just wrote proves nothing about a
body someone wrote to ship a release.

⛔ THE MUTANTS ARE ASSERTED TO HAVE APPLIED. A substitution that matched nothing yields an
unmutated copy that passes every assertion and reads exactly like a control that ran (this repo's
own measured lesson — `coord-review.selftest.py`'s `MUTANTS` table states it). Every mutation here
is checked for having changed the bytes before its result is believed.

⛔ AND THE SHIPPED FILE IS NEVER TOUCHED. Mutants are written into a temp directory; the original's
sha256 is taken before the first row and re-taken after the last, and a difference is a FAILURE of
this suite rather than a note — a guard that edits the thing it guards has no way to say so.

HERMETIC: no network, no `$HOME`, no coordination config. Everything it reads is in this
directory.

- The unit file now reads `/etc/acme/sync.env`; an install that kept its keys in the unit itself
